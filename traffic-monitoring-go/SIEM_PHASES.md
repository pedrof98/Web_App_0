# V2X SIEM Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation roadmap for a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system specifically designed for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. The system is being developed in three strategic phases to ensure a robust foundation with specialized automotive security capabilities.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core SIEM Infrastructure (Standard Protocols)

#### Modify Data Models
- ‚úÖ Extend models to accommodate security events
- ‚úÖ Create log and alert models
- ‚úÖ Implement event categorization and severity levels

#### Event Collection
- ‚è≥ Implement collectors for standard protocols (Syslog, SNMP, etc.)
- üîÑ Create an agent system for distributed collection
- ‚è≥ Set up queue-based ingestion for high throughput

#### Event Processing
- ‚è≥ Implement normalization of different event formats
- üîÑ Create correlation rules engine
- ‚è≥ Add real-time analysis capabilities

#### Alerting System
- ‚úÖ Define alert types and severity levels
- üîÑ Implement notification channels (email, webhook, etc.)
- ‚è≥ Create alert management workflow

#### Dashboard & Visualization
- üîÑ Create security-focused dashboards
- ‚è≥ Implement real-time monitoring views
- ‚è≥ Add historical analysis tools

### Phase 2: V2X-Specific Extensions

#### V2X Protocol Support
- ‚è≥ Add DSRC (Dedicated Short-Range Communications) collectors
- ‚è≥ Implement C-V2X (Cellular V2X) message handling
- ‚è≥ Support BSM (Basic Safety Messages) parsing

#### Automotive Security Rules
- ‚è≥ Implement V2X-specific detection rules
- ‚è≥ Create correlation for automotive threats
- ‚è≥ Add vehicle-specific context to alerts

#### Geographic Visualization
- ‚è≥ Add map-based views for vehicle events
- ‚è≥ Implement geofencing capabilities
- ‚è≥ Create route-based analytics

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

#### Machine Learning Integration
- ‚è≥ Implement anomaly detection for vehicle behavior
- ‚è≥ Add threat prediction capabilities
- ‚è≥ Create automatic response recommendations

#### Compliance Reporting
- ‚è≥ Add automotive security standard compliance checks
- ‚è≥ Implement audit reporting
- ‚è≥ Create evidence collection for incidents

#### Scalability Enhancements
- ‚è≥ Optimize for high-volume V2X data
- ‚è≥ Implement retention policies
- ‚è≥ Add distributed processing capabilities
